File Cleaner Script
<br />
+ Files For The Script:
  + Clean.bat
  + rp.vbs
+ How To Use
  + Download both files in the directory you want cleaned and open Clean.bat\
+ What Does This Script Do?
  + This script moves all of the files besides .bat, .vbs, and .lnk(shortcuts) to their extensions file in Files/. So if it moves test.png, it would be located at ~\Files\png\test.png
  + It can do bulk moving fast
